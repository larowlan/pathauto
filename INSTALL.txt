Note that pathauto is an extension to the path module, which must
be enabled.

1. Unpack the pathauto folder and contents in the modules directory of 
your Drupal installation.
2. Enable the pathauto module in the administration tools.
3. If you're not using Drupal's default administrative account, make
sure "administer pathauto" is enabled through access control administration.
4. Visit the pathauto settings page:
  When first installing pathauto, to define the desired alias patterns.
  When installing a new version of pathauto, to have any necessary
    database and variable upgrades applied.

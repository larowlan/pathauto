**Installation:

Note that pathauto is an extension to the path module, which must
be enabled.

1. Unpack the pathauto folder and contents in the modules directory of 
your Drupal installation.
2. Enable the pathauto module in the administration tools.
3. If you're not using Drupal's default administrative account, make
sure "administer pathauto" is enabled through access control administration.
4. Visit the pathauto settings page:
  When first installing pathauto, to define the desired alias patterns.

**Transliteration support:

If you desire transliteration support in the creation of URLs (e.g. the 
replacement of Ã€ with A) then you will need to rename the file 
i18n-ascii.example.txt to i18n-ascii.txt 

You can then freely edit the i18n-ascii.txt without worrying that your changes 
will be over-written by upgrades of Pathauto.
